In this repository, I have developed a Matlab code to optimize a pixelated metasurface using a genetic algorithm and a CST-Matlab interface code. I welcome any feedback that could help me enhance my code. Furthermore, I am open to any research opportunities in the field of nanophotonics and metastructures.
